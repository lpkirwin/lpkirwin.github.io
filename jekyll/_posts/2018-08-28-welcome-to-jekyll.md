You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

> In a step that is likely to lend legitimacy to virtual currencies — and create new concerns for Goldman — the bank is about to begin using its own money to trade with clients in a variety of contracts linked to the price of Bitcoin.

## Second heading

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the "source for this post" to get an idea about how it works.

### Third-level heading

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:[^1]

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
**Just some bold text.**

{% highlight python %}
# Do the machine learning
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_tr, y_tr)
lm.predict(X_te)
print("Sick! Nice work.")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def cool_math(x, y):
    a = x**y
    b = y**x
    return a + b + 76.2
{% endhighlight %}

**Bold text at the beginning of a paragraph.** Test edit. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
